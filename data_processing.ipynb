      "I would like to introduce myself by presenting the experience I had in Canada, when I visited the country in 2013. My father runs a business, and it was in trouble at the time. For several months, the company hadn’t yielded a single penny. My family wasn’t able to sustain our everyday life. So, I decided to go to Canada for 6 months to work. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got a job at a convenience store in Toronto. In that small store, I’ve learned many things I would otherwise have not learned. First, I learned to be responsible. I learned that when working at the store, I represent the store, and I am in charge of whatever happens. \n",
      "Second, I learned the meaning of hard work. Working hard is easier said than done. It takes endurance and commitment to work hard every day. The experience in Canada gave me the chance to discover those qualities in myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, that experience taught me to be positive. It definitely was a difficult situation, but it was also a chance to learn.\n",
      "15399 “you trust them, they trust you”\n",
      "When I was 15 years old, I went to the United States as an exchange student. I stayed with an American family in their house for 1 year. They really took me in as their family. That was when I learned the value of trust. Ever since, it has been my prime objective to have faith and be true with the people around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found out through experience that trusting people definitely helps to maintain solid friendship. Because I try to trust my friends, they also try to trust me, and that is how it gets easier to understand each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "It also helped when working together with others. For example, I had to do a team project with 3 of my classmates at school. We divided the work into 4 parts and each member was in charge of one. Because we trusted each other to complete their work, we could focus on our own task. Plus, we were more motivated to work hard. As a result, we were able to successfully finish the project.\n",
      "15400 “Give everything my best.”\n",
      "I think of job as an opportunity to explore my competence and potentials. That is why I take job seriously and wish to be great at it. To be great at what I do, whatever the job may be, takes efforts, and I have always given efforts to tasks given to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I worked at the convenience store in Toronto, I memorized prices of almost all of the items being sold at the store. Because I did so, I was able to keep the store open even when the barcode scanner in the store abruptly broke down. When I was tutoring a high school student, I went through articles of teaching methods that helped students perform better for reference. I presented a new study plan to the student, and we tried it. She gained confidence in writing tests and her marks improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is my principle to do my best at what I do, and my desire to be great at what I do is the driving force that makes me try. I would like the opportunity to do my best at KIC.\n",
      "15401 Like I mentioned above, my goal is to be good at my job.\n",
      "In 5 years, I would like to be able to make professional analysis on markets. I would like to be able to assess certain situation and explain what forces were at work to yield that outcome. More importantly, I would like to know what to do at the situation, based on my analysis.\n",
      "In 10 years, I would like to be able to make careful predictions on future market situations. \n",
      "What I am doing now for that is to start from the basics. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is why I formed a small study group with my classmates at school. We try to apply the knowledge we learned from the books to what happens in the real world. We try to understand why certain index or price changed, with help of analysis made by professional analysts. I also subscribe  magazine and read books to keep me updated.\n",

I became interested in Japanese financial world after witnessing that it was still full of vitality even after global financial crisis 2007-08. Above all, I’m dreaming of myself working in Mizuho Bank as an expert in international economy thanks to its diverse opportunity to cultivate one’s capability.\n",

This project gave me technological knowledge in both database management and web-application.\n",
      "Also I have experience in project related to IoT(Internet of Things). To implement IoT, I made a project called Smart flowerpot. I connected several communication and humidity sensors to Atmega128 which is a kind of AVR. To control AVR, I should have to write rich code which can control AVR. However, it was quite difficult for me because it needed interrupting code compared to the normal C programming(procedure oriented programming). Even though I was not familiar with it initially, I could do well by undergoing trial and error.  \n",

Amongst them was the international investment club where I took a responsible position as the president of the club from the infant stage. I, along with a help of my mentor from a securities firm, arranged meetings to organize how to publicize the club and mainly to gain a broader view by studying English and foreign economic markets.

Further, I collected the foreign exchange information of a country or a firm using Bloomberg Terminal and DART, and sometimes translated reports/termsheets written from the SC Bank headquarter. While at FnGuide, I assisted in providing monthly reports on an overall financial market in Korea and calculated annualized daily returns of pension funds such as teacher’s pension and national property pension. Seven months of internship had given me opportunities to understand financial instruments including FX, stock, bond, and fund.

      "Since I was young, I’ve had the privilege to explore various cultures and learn global mind. When I was 5, I lived in Indonesia and went to international school for 1 year. As a 9th grade school girl, I participated in an academic exchange student program, and spent a year going to school in the United States.

I felt it was our responsibility to the customers to provide them with the supplies they needed, especially when the store was the only place with electricity in the neighborhood.

      "26431 I worked as an intern in architectural office (HAUD) and was involved in Prugio apartment building design project in June 2013. The project was nearly at the final stage of design work when I started working in my team. It was a great work experience that I could have an opportunity to perform actual design work in real world. However, there were a lot of restrictions and limitation of design that I could actually present and it was different to other architecture project, which I had been doing in the university. \n",
      "\n",
      "My initial design proposals were all rejected by my seniors because they were not close enough to be materialized. It was the time that I was confused by the huge gap between my expectation and the reality in which provides only a few choice of design option. I thought there was nothing I could do about it and worried a little bit about the rest of the working period because I thought I would be end up with producing just ‘normal’ design. But I eventually understood and accepted the fact that firms and companies are where produce profits, not my ‘canvas’ which I can freely express imagination and virtualize. \n",
      "\n",
      "I learnt how to stay creative but this can be allowed when you follow the rules and order first only. I decided to dive into the given situation and come up with the best solution for it. I started to investigate design examples used for similar projects and learn from ‘what is given’ and ‘what can be produced out of it’. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I didn’t stop producing series of facade design that can be used as inspiration for others. I tried to find best concept of the design with keep sketching and simulating them alongside the given tasks. I strongly believed that there was no correct answer for design but there should be a room for compromise. I also believed that final design can be created when ideas from every single member is agreed. To make this happen, \n",
      "\n",
      "I had no doubt that inspiring each other was very important. When my team was stuck in short range of options for some new idea or alteration of design, my design proposals, which seemed ‘unrealistic’ was actually helpful. Because, another intern and my senior architects, we all could share and explore ideas and sometimes went back to the initial stage of design activity and review it. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was also an efficient way for me, who was the newest member because I could learn more from my experienced seniors who know well how to develop the initial stage of work to next step in given condition. I believe that I made the best out of my position as a new and the least experienced member but it was such a great chance to be in my colleagues’ trust.\n",
      "26432 Sampling and promotional event of CJ Bibigo held in TESCOs in London gave me an insight into the basic field of sales and marketing. The main job was to provide food sampling to customers and advertise CJ Bibigo products (e.g. cooking sauces and dumplings). I tried to put the most my effort, particularly on making marketing strategy so that products which are relatively low on brand-name recognition can become popular among European people. \n",
      "\n",
      "It also required me to do multi-tasking that I had to suggest trying new food with recommendation and continued to sales at the end. Given time was limited to 7 or 8 hours per day so I focused on the communication with the store managers and staffs as well as setting up an efficient sales strategy. In order to prove the high possibility of success of sampling event, I asked for deputy manager’s and other staff’s co-orperation and then demonstrated cooking in front of them first. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I received support and permission from them, I reported track of inventory and sales estimates to my manager and store managers at the beginning of sampling events. Also, I tried to find a spot where sales and promotion can be maximized so that the gaps between the event table and the shelves where promoting products are displayed can be shorten. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to attract customers, I increased the number of table-displayed products and stacked empty packaging boxes right next to the table. Feedbacks and surveys on food or sampling service contributed me to figure out what makes customers to decide purchase and what makes them to hesitate or refuse to buy the products. As a result, I could achieve sales increase of 87.5% and ranked 1st among the other promoters. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another example can be seen in my work experience in a commercial art gallery in London. My job as a manager was to promote the gallery and provide multiple options of exhibition layout for artists and designers to show their art work in the most efficient way. \n",
      "\n",
      "The size of the space was rather small compared to other galleries so I tried to make the best solution for the exhibition space so that the efficiency can be maximized when it’s in use. While performing designing activities at my university, I could learn more about the value of the designing, which serves as a valuable asset to provide brand and customer-focused environment as well as enhance sales performance. \n",

      "In this sense, I realized that sales and marketing have similar process with designing works in terms of convincing customers with the most satisfying plans and I applied my skills of interpreting corporate brand or product philosophy into spaces in a clear visual manner. Whenever I had to suggest options and proposals for exhibition layout, I applied extra design work into the space in order to maximise the characteristics of the artists’ work. As a result, most of the artists I worked with were happy with their exhibition and it also helped me to develop my coordinating ability.\n",

My short-term goal is to find a best position where I can maximize the use of my knowledge and strength I have. I will contribute what I have learnt though my education and work experience.
